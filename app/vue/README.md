Storybook for Vue is a UI development environment for your Vue components.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i -g @storybook/cli
cd my-vue-app
getstorybook
```

For more information visit: [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org)

## Starter Storybook-for-Vue Boilerplate project with [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify) Material Component Framework

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.

## Vue Notes

-   When using global custom components or extension (e.g `Vue.use`). You will need to declare those in the `./storybook/config.js`.
